# LillyMod ![Lilly Emblem](./LillyMod/objects/lilly/emblem/lillyemblembig.png)
This is a mod for Starbound. It contains an asorted amount of changes and additions to Starbound.
Lilly is my cat who is a 7 year old calico, and she is so cute I just had to name a mod after her.

This mod is updated for ```Starbound v. Glad Giraffe```

To install please download from the releases or if you only want the source code, then download source. Then you want to put either LillyMod.pak or LillyMod source folder into your /giraffe_storage/mods folder.

This mod has some "cheaty" items in it, you cannot craft these and they have to spawn them in.
Here are the list of the item name to spawn them in with ```/spawnitem```
