  "description" : "The name of this mod is based off of Thaky's kitty, Lilly.\n\nThis mod contains armor, weapons and objects. The armor is an endtiered armor set and is titled, Zorabian Armor, this armor is not based off of anything, but is Thaky's own creation. The armor has been balanced and with other mods, such as Fraking Universe, it does change to not being an end tier armor set. There is an admin version of the armor set and is only able to be spawned in via admin mode (more details in the item list for this mod).\n\nThe Weapons in this mod is first the Void Excalibur, which is a top tier sword that has a unique texture and not so unique secondary ability; the secondary abality is planned on changing in the future. The second weapon is the Zorabain Assault rifle, it is a high powered rifle, and it too has a seconddary ability already in the game and is going to be changed in the future.\n\nOther misc items are the Zorcan Crystal, which is a element created by infusion of all tier 5 ores and solarium. This item is used only for creating Zorabian products like the Void Excalibur or Zorabian Armor.\n\nA new pet texture to the cat provides Thaky's kitty, Lilly to beable to be a pet. If you want to have lilly specificly you must download the Purchasable Pets mod. With the Purchasable Pets mod being an optional mod, DO NOT use the Lilly's Pet House if you are going to not get the Purchasable Pets mod.\n\nSome other objects that have been added, is a painting of Lilly, a emblem of Lilly's paw (not actually Lilly's paw), and some other hidden objects that have yet to be implemented.",
